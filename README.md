# Cybersecurity Enthusaist

### Who am I?
I'm Qin Xin. I have took a look around the blockchain sphere and found that it is too financialised for my liking. So, I took a step back and thought about the direction which I believe the world is heading to. And I realised that the world will more reliant on technology - AI and Cybersecurity are the 2 domains that I believe will be evermore important. As I have previously took a glance into AI with some projects and theories, it didn't resonate with me.

So, now I am going into cybersecurity. Learning through CTFs and TryHackMe, the problem solving aspect has been challenging and I love a good challenge :D

I find I need a mix of the bustle of the city and the tranquility of the nature. So, I have been helping out at a community garden. And since there was quite an abundant of space, I was given some space which I converted into 2 garden beds to plant my own stuff!

Currently, I have harvested:
- Cherry tomato

Awaiting harvest:
- Blueberries
- Papapya

### Cool Projects
- FPGA: This is another school project where we learn to programme a field programmable gate array (FPGA). Initially, I was thinking what is the point of such low-levels programming but as time passes and I learnt more aobut the range of application, I was very impressed by its utility in regards to speed and parallel processnig.
- Design Thinking Innovation: This was a module in school where we have to come up with solutions to a problem. The main challenge for me was identifying the problem and the context (user and culture). Thankfully, we managed to overcome it and came up with a solution that combines nature, shade and artistic design. 
- RoboClash: This was my first time working on an actual robotic project and the burning of midnight oil with a team that I enjoy spending time was great! Helped me appreciate the difficulty of making a robot "just go straight".
- Building a neural network from scratch with just basic Python (no libraries) and understanding how it actually works
