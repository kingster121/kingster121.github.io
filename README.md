# Cybersecurity Enthusaist

### Who am I?
I'm Qin Xin. I have took a look around the blockchain sphere and found that it is too financialised for my liking. So, I took a step back and thought about the direction which I believe the world is heading to. And I realised that the world will more reliant on technology - AI and Cybersecurity are the 2 domains that I believe will be evermore important. As I have previously took a glance into AI with some projects and theories, it didn't resonate with me.

So, now I am going into cybersecurity. Learning through CTFs and TryHackMe, the problem solving aspect has been challenging and I love a good challenge :D

I find I need a mix of the bustle of the city and the tranquility of the nature. So, I have been helping out at a community garden. And since there was quite an abundant of space, I was given some space which I converted into 2 garden beds to plant my own stuff!

Currently, I have harvested:
- Cherry tomato

Awaiting harvest:
- Blueberries
- Papapya

### Cool Projects
- FPGA (Tap of War): Learning about field programmable gate array (FPGA) was interesting, my opinion went from, what is the point of this to being very impressed with its utility in regards to speed and parallel processing as I learn more about it. Created a game using Alchitry Lab's Au Board, here is the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsm4qkcwFQ).
- Design Thinking Innovation: This was a term 2 module in SUTD where we have to come up with solutions to a problem. The main challenge for me was identifying the problem and the context (user and culture). Thankfully, we managed to overcome it and came up with a solution that combines nature, shade and artistic design. Some of the technology used that was new to me was the working with PDLC film and CV. Here is the [video](https://youtu.be/yA7ak7VMIGc) showcasing the functional prototype that I have worked on.
- RoboClash: This was my first time working on an actual robotic project and the burning of midnight oil with a team that I enjoy spending time was great! Helped me appreciate the difficulty of making a robot "just go straight".
- Building a neural network from scratch: With just basic Python (no libraries) and understanding how it actually works behind the hood
