# Cybersecurity Enthusaist

### Who am I?
I'm Qin Xin. I have took a look around the blockchain sphere and found that it is too financialised for my liking. So, I took a step back and looked around, finding that with the emergence of AI, Big Data and IT/OT convergence, the need for cybersecurity is ever more important.

üñ≥ For IT security, I am learning through CTFs and TryHackMe, the problem solving aspect has been challenging and I love a good challenge :D

üè≠ As for OT security, as luck would have it, I am able to get some Omron PLC relatively cheaply and is tinkering with it. Currently, I am learning things from the perspective of a engineer by working with the ladder logic and electronic. 
- Controllable I/O (Switch and LED) ‚òëÔ∏è
- Exploiting vulnerabilities 
- SCADA

üè° A mix of the bustle of the city and the tranquility of the nature is needed in my life. So, I have been helping out at a community garden. And since there was quite an abundant of space, I was given some space which I converted into 2 garden beds to plant my own stuff!

- Research Intern @ Treehouse (Dec 2022 - May 2023)

### Cool Projects
- Home Lab PLC: I find OT security to be quite an interesting field as it is vastly different from IT security, where the main key is availability. I am currently learning more about operational technology through Omron PLC and CX-Programmer and got a simple setup of switches and LEDs working. Looking to work towards implementing SCADA and finding vulnerabilities in the system.
- FPGA (Tap of War): Learning about field programmable gate array (FPGA) was interesting, my opinion went from, what is the point of this to being very impressed with its utility in regards to speed and parallel processing as I learn more about it. Created a game using Alchitry Lab's Au Board, here is the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsm4qkcwFQ).
- Design Thinking Innovation: This was a term 2 module in SUTD where we have to come up with solutions to a problem. The main challenge for me was identifying the problem and the context (user and culture). Thankfully, we managed to overcome it and came up with a solution that combines nature, shade and artistic design. Some of the technology used that was new to me was the working with PDLC film and CV. Here is the [video](https://youtu.be/yA7ak7VMIGc) showcasing the functional prototype that I have worked on.
- RoboClash: This was my first time working on an actual robotic project and the burning of midnight oil with a team that I enjoy spending time was great! Helped me appreciate the difficulty of making a robot "just go straight".
- Building a neural network from scratch: With just basic Python (no libraries) and understanding how it actually works behind the hood
